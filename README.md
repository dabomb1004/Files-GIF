# Verizon-App-Revamp

The gif is a quick summary of the app revamp ideas my team and I came up with for our summer internship collaborative project. We wanted to simplify the current layout
and make the overall user experience less cumbersome in terms of getting to the other parts of the app. One of the defining features was adding a navbar at the bottom
where users could easily move to the 4 or 5 most used parts of the app. Using adobe analytics and pivot tables our team was able to verify through data that sections 
such as Verizon Up Rewards was frequently used by Users. However, a large number of customers complained that they needed to open the side navbar and then locate Verizon
Up Rewards before clicking on it just to see their montly rewards. To remove this hassle, our team included the Verizon Up rewards in the navbar so users could quickly 
tap and get to see any great deals they got.
